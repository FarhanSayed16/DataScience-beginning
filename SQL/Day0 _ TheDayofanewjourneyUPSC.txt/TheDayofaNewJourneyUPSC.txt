On this day- 20-00-2025, i got a new thought of becomming a civil servent as an IAS officer, i am not sure what, where the destiny will take me, but try karne mein kya hi jaata hai!,

i had many regrets in my life, so hence forth i will do things as they come, without overthinking and without the fear of failure. i dont want to be a person who regrets not trying, i want to be a person who tries and learns from the experience, no matter the outcome.

no more regrets henceforthh!!!
