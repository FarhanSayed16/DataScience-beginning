Perfect 👍 you want me to **go deeper into each query** — explaining not only *what it does* but also *why we used certain functions/clauses* (like `DISTINCT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`) and what would happen if we didn’t. Let’s break it down one by one:

---

## 🔹 **Q1**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT b.userid, u.name, u.email
FROM Buyer b
JOIN Users u ON b.userid = u.userid
JOIN Address a ON u.userid = a.userid;
```

### ✅ What it’s doing:

* Fetches **only buyers** (`Buyer b` table).
* Connects them with their **user details** (`Users u`).
* Ensures they have at least one **address** (`Address a`).
* Uses **`DISTINCT`** → to prevent duplicates (because a buyer can have multiple addresses).

### ❌ If we did not use `DISTINCT`:

* Suppose Buyer **101** has 3 addresses → their `userid, name, email` would show **3 times**.
* That would make the result repetitive and messy.

### ❓ Why only `DISTINCT` and not `GROUP BY`?

* `GROUP BY` could also work, but we don’t need to aggregate data here — we just want **unique rows**.
* `DISTINCT` is lighter and simpler when the goal is just **removing duplicates**.

---

## 🔹 **Q2**

```sql
SELECT s.userid, u.name AS seller_name, st.sid, st.storeName
FROM Seller s
JOIN Users u ON s.userid = u.userid
JOIN Manage m ON s.userid = m.userid
JOIN Store st ON m.sid = st.sid;
```

### ✅ What it’s doing:

* Finds all **sellers** and their **store(s)**.
* Uses multiple **`JOIN`s** to link:

  * `Seller → Users` (to get seller details).
  * `Seller → Manage → Store` (to get stores they manage).

### ❌ If we did not use JOINs:

* We would not be able to combine info across tables.
* Example: If you only query `Seller`, you’d see just seller IDs, but not their names or stores.
* If you only query `Store`, you’d see stores but not *who manages them*.

### ❓ Why only `JOIN` and not `Subquery`?

* `JOIN` makes it efficient and cleaner since we are combining data row-by-row.
* A `subquery` could do the same, but would be longer, harder to read, and slower in big databases.

## 🔹 **Q3**

```sql
SELECT p.pid, p.productName, p.price, b.brandName
FROM Product p
JOIN Brand b ON p.bid = b.bid
WHERE p.price > 20000;
```

### ✅ What it’s doing:

* Shows **products** with their brand.
* Uses **`WHERE p.price > 20000`** to filter only expensive items.
* Joins `Product` with `Brand` so we see **brand names** instead of just `bid`.

### ❌ If we did not use `WHERE`:

* We’d get **all products**, including cheap ones (like a ₹200 pen or ₹1000 charger).
* The query would not answer the actual requirement of “greater than 20000”.

### ❌ If we did not use `JOIN`:

* We’d see only product IDs with `bid` (brand ID), not the **brandName**.
* Example: Instead of *“iPhone – Apple”* you’d see *“iPhone – 1”* (just the brand ID).

---

## 📝 Summary (Why each function is necessary)

* **`DISTINCT`** → avoids duplicate buyers (clean output).
* **`JOIN`** → essential to combine data from multiple related tables.
* **`WHERE`** → filters results to match conditions (like `price > 20000`).

Without them, results would either be **incomplete**, **messy**, or **not matching the question**.

👉 Do you want me to now rewrite these queries using **alternative methods** (like using `GROUP BY`, subqueries, or EXISTS) so you can see different ways to solve the same problem and compare?
