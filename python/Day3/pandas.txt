# Importing pandas
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Amit', 'Priya', 'Rahul'],
        'Age': [20, 22, 21]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

# Reading data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Selecting a column
print(df['Name'])

# Filtering rows
print(df[df['Age'] > 20])

# Handling missing values
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Grouping and
