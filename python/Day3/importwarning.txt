What is ImportWarning in Python?
-------------------------------
ImportWarning is a built-in warning category in Python. It is raised when there is a potential issue with an import statement, such as deprecated modules, ambiguous imports, or other import-related problems. By default, ImportWarning is ignored, but it can be enabled to help developers catch potential issues during development.

How is ImportWarning Used?
-------------------------
- Python may issue an ImportWarning when it detects something unusual or potentially problematic with an import.
- You can manually trigger an ImportWarning using the warnings module.
- You can also configure Python to display ImportWarnings.

Examples:
---------

# Example 1: Manually triggering an ImportWarning
import warnings

warnings.warn("This is an import warning example.", ImportWarning)

# Example 2: Enabling ImportWarnings to be shown
import warnings

warnings.simplefilter('always', ImportWarning)
warnings.warn("This import warning will always be shown.", ImportWarning)

# Example 3: ImportWarning for deprecated modules (simulated)
try:
    import some_deprecated_module  # This may trigger an ImportWarning in real scenarios
except ImportError:
    print("Module not found.")

# Note: By default, ImportWarnings are ignored. To see them, use the -Wd flag when running Python:
# python -Wd
