Types of EDA:

1. Univariate Analysis
    - Examines one variable at a time.
    - Helps understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread.
    - Example: Histograms, box plots, summary statistics.

2. Bivariate Analysis
    - Analyzes the relationship between two variables.
    - Helps identify correlations or associations.
    - Example: Scatter plots, correlation coefficients, cross-tabulations.

3. Multivariate Analysis
    - Involves analysis of more than two variables.
    - Helps uncover complex relationships and interactions.
    - Example: Pair plots, heatmaps, multivariate regression.

4. Graphical Analysis
    - Uses visualizations to summarize and explore data.
    - Makes patterns, trends, and outliers easier to spot.
    - Example: Bar charts, line plots, pie charts.

5. Non-Graphical Analysis
    - Uses summary statistics and numerical methods.
    - Provides quantitative insights into data.
    - Example: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.
