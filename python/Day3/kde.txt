What is KDE in Data Science?
----------------------------
KDE stands for Kernel Density Estimation. It is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable. KDE is used to visualize the distribution of data, providing a smooth curve that represents the data's underlying distribution.

Why is KDE Used?
----------------
- To understand the distribution and shape of data
- To identify peaks, spread, and modality (number of modes)
- As an alternative to histograms for visualizing distributions

Example (using seaborn in Python):
----------------------------------
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
sns.kdeplot(data)
plt.title("Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) Plot")
