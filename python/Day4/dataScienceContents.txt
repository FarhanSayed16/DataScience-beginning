Mindset
    - Start simple (baseline), iterate with measurement
    - Automate repetitive analysis
    - Treat data tasks as software (tests, versioning, refactors)
    - Communicate early, often, clearly

Outcome
    - Ability to take raw data → cleaned dataset → model → deployed solution → monitored system with documented decisions.

Suggested First Action
    - Set up environment (conda or venv), create a reproducible template repo (src/, notebooks/, tests/, data/, requirements.txt, README).
    - Pick one public dataset and produce a polished exploratory + modeling report.
